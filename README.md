# Escape from Tarkov: Super Fierce Hatchling Full-Auto training bot

[English Document](README.md) | [中文(中华人民共和国)文档](README_zh_CN.md)| [中文(中華民國/台灣)文檔](README_zh_TW.md)

This bot is based on Arduino board that have USB capabilities, tested on Arduino Leonardo and Arduino Pro Micro(ATmega32u4).

# What super fierce hatchling training bot dose ?

this little project uses Arduino boards simulate Keyboards & Mice & Tablet , controlling your PC that running Escape from Tarkov game instance, mainly leveling up your in-game skills "**Endurance**", "**Strength**", "**Covert Movement**".

# How to run this bot and training your own muscle rat ?

1. You'll need a Arduino board that have ATmega32u4 processor on it, my recommendation is Arduino Leonardo(Arduino Official) or Arduino Pro Micro(3rd-party edition), because I've working on those 2 module for quite a while and all function running normal on those 2 module.
  
2. You'll need a PC capable to run EFT game instance at [1280x720 , minimal graphic quality, 10 FPS or higher]
  
3. You'll need Arduino IDE to burn the program into the board so your board can execute it.
  
4. Display resolution requirements: No specific requirements, but must be 16:9, for example : 1280x720, 1600x900 , 1920x1080 , 2560x1440
  

# How to burn the program into Arduino board ?

# For Developers that trying to tweak this bot for yourself:
